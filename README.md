# Factor Model Discription for Visualize yourself Project
### Title:  The Effect of weekly walking time/distance on my walking Speed 

For this Factor model I considered folowing variables which would affect my walking speed that will be measured weekly for 1 mile at a certain lap.



  - weight/age/sex/fitness level/sleep quality/time of the day/diet/exercise
  


for me and during the time that I will calculate the data , these variable are constant:
  - sex/age/time of the day
  

I am interested in analyze how the distance/time that I walk per week improves my walking speed and aerobic fitness over time.
##### I will calculate these variavles daily:
  - wakling time (minutes with my smartwatch)
  - walking distance(miles/steps with my smartwatch)
  - resting heart rate(bit/min  with my smartwatch)
   - time of sleep(hours with my smartwatch)
   - weight(pounds with my scale)
